        This app was created with the purpose of reducing plastic building up in
        landfills and spilling over into habitats. Gardening is a productive
        hobby and a great way to contribute to creating biodiversity in your
        yard. Unfortunately, there is a lot of plastic involved in gardening and
        I hope to eliminate plastic id tags by giving people the opportunity to
        store their plant information digitally.
