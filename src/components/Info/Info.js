                <p>This app was created with the purpose of reducing plastic building up in landfills and spilling over into habitats. Gardening is a productive hobby and a great way to contribute to creating biodiversity in your yard. Unfortunately, there is a lot of plastic involved in gardening and I hope to eliminate plastic id tags by giving people the opportunity to store their plant information digitally.</p>
